EJS
Embedded javascript
Allows for dynamic insertion of html into ejs html templates. Saves having to write the same template 1 million times etc

Need a folders called views
Inside this, setup html file as normal, but with extension .ejs

Inside .js file, using with express
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

Example
app.js
res.render("list", {kindOfDay: day});
inject custom html from js file

list.ejs
<%=kinfOfDay %>;   .js 
Tag for indicating where ejs will inject html


Example 2
<%%>
Use custom js in lists.ejs file. Need new tag for EVERY LINE

res.redirect("/");
redirects post to home route



Layouts/partials
Keep header/footer constant, ejs change the content
<%- include("header") -%>
<%- include("footer") -%>
include ALL html including and above <body> in header.ejs,
ALL html incuding and below <footer> in footer.ejs


Modules
const date = require(__dirname + "/date.js"); //My custom date module
include a modules call date.js

Inside date.js -> module.exports.getDate = getDate;
Exports the function getDate from date.js as a member of the module import object

Easier export, define function as export member immediately
exports.getDay = function() { ....}
Will then be accessible from an imported module object
